## Ideas to Add

* More interactive buttons that do silly things
* “Type Monkey” trolling mini-game
* Endless loading timers / countdowns to absurd events
* Music that auto-plays for maximum chaos
* ASCII art gallery for pure text-based memes

## Notes

* Some features like autoplay music might require hosting, not just local files.
* GIFs and logos work best if hosted or in the same folder.
* This is purely for fun — don’t take it seriously
